# 📝 Task Manager App (Trello's Clone)- kanban -board

A **Kanban-style task management application** inspired by [Trello](https://trello.com), built initially with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **LocalStorage**. You can add, edit, delete, and move tasks between columns with a clean drag-and-drop UI.

> ⚠️ This is the initial version using pure frontend technologies.  
> ✅ I plan to upgrade it into a full-stack production-grade app with **React**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **authentication** features.
